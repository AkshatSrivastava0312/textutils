# textutils
This is my first website in django
<br>
This website is a combination of personal portfolio and a text analyzer 
<ul>
  <li> Personal Portfolio contains a landing page and an About page (designed just to make website a bit stylish)</li>
  <li> A Text Analyzer tool (heart of this project) which has the following functions:-
    <br>
    1. Count Characters in a given text<br>
    2. Remove Punctuations in a given text<br>
    1. Remove White Spaces in a given text<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
